# GROUP BY LECTURE

# The "GROUP BY" clause is used to aggregate a table into various groups of shared characteristics.
#
# Grouping data is often accompanied with the use of aggregate functions to derive additional information
# about the various groupings.
#
# Most common aggregate functions are:
#
#     MIN()
#     MAX()
#     SUM()
#     AVG()
#     COUNT()
#
# One or multiple columns may be grouped together.
#
# No table columns may exist in a SELECT clause that are not contained in the GROUP BY clause.
#
#     The GROUP BY clause is after an optional where clause and before an optional order by clause.
#
#     The order of a result set may be by an aggregate column but an aggregate column cannot be referenced in a where clause.
#
# A having clause is a way to use aggregate results as if in a where clause.

# --------- Grouping by a single column

select * from titles;

SELECT gender FROM employees; # all genders of all employees listed

SELECT DISTINCT gender from employees; # all distinct genders in company

SELECT gender FROM employees # creating groups of employees by gender
GROUP BY gender;

SELECT gender, COUNT(*) from employees # how many are in each gender group?
GROUP BY gender;


# How many people share the same hire date?
# How many people hold each title?


# --------- Grouping by multiple columns


# How many employees share the same birthday?


# How many male and female employees share the same birthday?
SELECT gender, birth_date, COUNT(*) from employees
GROUP BY gender, birth_date ORDER BY COUNT(*);

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees

# COUNT function

# Find total number of employees
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;

# Find the most common name

# Find total number of female and male employees
SELECT gender, COUNT(*) FROM employees
GROUP BY gender;

# MIN and MAX
# Select the first and last hire date for each first name
SELECT first_name, MIN(hire_date) as 'First Hired', MAX(hire_date) as 'Last Hired' FROM employees
GROUP BY first_name;
